# Building a HTTP endpoint with Vert.x

Let's say you heard about [Eclipse Vert.x](http://vertx.io) and you want to start right away to better understand what's this _beast_. This tutorial is a good start as you learn:

* what's vert.x briefly
* how to create a HTTP server
* how to produce JSON responses
* how to get query parameters
* what's an event loop and how it's used to dispatch your requests

It's going to take 10 minutes to complete, so better start now!
